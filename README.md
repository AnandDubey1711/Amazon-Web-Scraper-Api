In case of your own API development Node module folder is to be installed by yourself due to its size it could not be pushed onto this project To install the node module you need to first create a package.json file and then you need to copy all the dependencies which i have used inside the package.json then you need to run the command "npm i" which would install all the required dependecies as well as the node modules folder.

Have a good day!
